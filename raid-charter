:Tryheart:  Welcome Tryhearts! :Tryheart: 
Here's a reference guide to everything that you should know while raiding with our team.

1. TEAM PROFILE

Tryhearts are a semi-hardcore raiding team that puts emphasis on teamwork and achieving goals together. We do our homework, come prepared, clear the raids while having some friendly banter, and then go on to enjoy other activities this game has to offer. Most of all, we do our best to avoid any and all drama, as to keep our raiding atmosphere light and enjoyable.

To ensure all members of the team are pulling their weight we might ask underperformers to step down from raiding with us, however our first instinct is always to try to include people, talk with them over the problems they might be experiencing and help them get better at playing WoW Classic. We believe that the main ingredient to improvement is the will to work for it.

We raid two days a week, Wednesday and Sunday. Our official raid time is 19:00 till 23:00 server time. We require valid PvE talent specializations and the use of consumables. We encourage gathering of world buffs before the raids and we organize events which help with it.

2. LOOT

We're employing an open Loot Council approach. The council consists of five members. Two of them are the Raid Leader and Backup Raid Leader, while three are chosen from Council Volunteers on raid-by-raid basis by the Raid Leader. Council spots are divided between representatives of different roles to ensure diverse insight going into loot decisions. Council Volunteers have roughly equal amount of time serving on the council.

Every team member can volunteer for the council, given they fulfil the following criteria:
1) have RCLootCouncil addon installed and know how to use it,
2) be familiar with current gear of all team members,
3) know the Tryhearts Loot Priority sheet and understand the reasoning that went into it:

4) keep up to date on current discussions in #tryhearts_loot_council,
5) keep up to date with the spreadsheet aggregating raider data,
6) know the two following BiS lists and understand the reasonings that went into them:

Council Volunteers are vetted by the team management, usually either by the Raid Leader or Backup Raid Leader.

Council members have one vote each and assign items with a majority vote.
In the absence of majority of votes on any single person the item is rolled between all players receiving at least one vote.

Council members cannot abstain from voting, they have to vote.

Council decisions are final and are not to be questioned during the raid. Loot talk during the raid is to be kept to a minimum, preferably none altogether.
However, all loot council decisions can be discusses after the raid in the #tryhearts_loot_council channel.
Should the #tryhearts_loot_council determine that a Terrible Mistake™️ has been made and loot was assigned in a way that doesn't benefit the team, steps are taken to prevent such case from reoccurring in the future.

Example 1: There's 5 people on the council. 3 have voted for person A, 1 for person B and 1 for person C. Person A gets the item.
Example 2: There's 5 people on the council. 2 have voted for person A, 2 for person B and 1 for person C. People A, B and C roll for the item.

3. BUFFS AND DEBUFFS

Buffing responsibility is divided amongst all team members, with members of a given class deciding between themselves who buffs which group with what buff.

Debuff slots are restricted to the following:

PHYSICAL DPS
1.     Sunder Armor
2.     Faerie Fire
3.     Curse of Recklessness
4.     Gift of Arthas
5.     Hunter's Mark
6.     Expose Weakness, Hunter T2 8/8
MAGICAL DPS
7.     Curse of Shadow
8.     Curse of the Elements
9.     Improved Shadow Bolt
10.   Winter's Chill
11.    Shadow Word: Pain (if not available then: Corruption)
12.   Shadow Weaving (if not available then: Corruption)
DEFENSIVE/UTILITY (can be omitted for Corruption on easy encounters)
13.    Thunderfury nature resist debuff
14.    Thunderfury attack speed slow / Thunder Clap
15.    Demoralizing Shout
16.    Judgement of Light / Wisdom

In order to maximize the damage potential of the raid we don't permit any other debuffs.
